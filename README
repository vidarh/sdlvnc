\mainpage SDL_vnc - SDL VNC Client library

\section intro_sec Introduction

The SDL_vnc library was created to offer a VNC client system that:
- is LGPL licensed and can be used in commercial applications
- integrates with SDL (framebuffer is a SDL surface)
- IO and processing runs as a thread, so it does not interfere with a traditional "game loop"

The current components of the SDL_vnc library are:
- the VNC library (SDL_vnc.h, SDL_vnc.c)
- various helpers (d3des.c, d3des.h, inet_pton.c, charhexout.h)

This library is licenced under the LGPL, see the file LICENSE for details.

\section platforms_sec Supported Platforms

The library compiles and is tested on a Linux target with a TightVNC server running on windows.
Visual studio solutions for Win32 (and Win64) builds are provided.


\section install_sec Installation and Test

To compile the library your need the SDL 1.2 installed from source or 
installed with the 'devel' RPM package. For example on Mandrake, run:
	urpmi libSDL1.2-devel

Then run
\verbatim
	./autogen.sh	(optional)
	./configure
	make
	make install
	ldconfig
\endverbatim

to compile and install the library. The default location for the 
installation is /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include. The libary 
path /usr/local/lib might need to be added to the file /etc/ld.so.conf
then run ldconfig again.


\subsection api_sec API and Usage

\verbatim
int vncConnect(tSDL_vnc *vnc, char *host, int port, char *mode, char *password, int framerate);

  Connect to VNC server 

  Parameters
   vnc  = pointer to tSDL_vnc structure
   host = hostname or hostip
   port = port
   mode = submode,submode,...
    submode =	raw | 
    		copyrect | 
    		rre | 
    		corre(broken) |
    		hextile | 
    		zrle(unimplemented) | 
    		cursor | 
    		desktop(unimplemented)
   password = text
   framerate = 1 to 100

  Notes;
   - Returns 1 if connection was established, 0 otherwise.
   - This call will establish a connection to the VNC server requesting a 32bit transfer.
   - framerate is the rate in which update requests are send to the server.


 
int vncBlitFramebuffer(tSDL_vnc *vnc, SDL_Surface *target, SDL_Rect *urec);

 Blit current framebuffer to target

 Parameters
  vnc = pointer to tSDL_vnc structure
  target = target surface to blit framebuffer to
  urec = pointer to SDL_Rect structure to receive updated area, can be NULL

  Notes:
   - Returns 1 if the blit occured, 0 otherwise.
   - Only blits if framebuffer exists and was updated. 
   - Updated region is stored in urec if it is not NULL.
   - Framebuffer is a RGB surface.


 
int vncBlitCursor(tSDL_vnc *vnc, SDL_Surface *target, SDL_Rect *trec);

  Blit current cursor to target

  Parameters
   vnc = pointer to tSDL_vnc structure
   target = target surface to blit cursoe to
   trec = pointer to SDL_Rect structure to receive updated area, can be NULL
 
  Notes
   - Returns 1 if blit occured, 0 otherwise 
   - Blitting is at the trec position.
   - Cursor image is a 32x32 RGBA image (with A set).




SDL_Rect vncCursorHotspot(tSDL_vnc *vnc);



  Parameters
   vnc = pointer to tSDL_vnc structure

  Notes: 
   - In the returned parameter, only .x and .y are used.



int vncClientKeyevent(tSDL_vnc *vnc, unsigned char downflag, unsigned int key);
int vncClientPointerevent(tSDL_vnc *vnc, unsigned char buttonmask, unsigned short x, unsigned short y);

  Send keyboard and pointer events to server

  Parameters
   vnc = pointer to tSDL_vnc structure
   downflag = 1 for key is down, 0 for key is up
   key = VNC keycode (basically X11/keysymdef.h plus some special codes)
   buttonmask = VNC mousebutton bitmask 1=left, 2-=middle, 4=right, 8/16=wheel
   x,y = mouse position

  Notes:
   - The client is responsible for key-code conversions into the VNC format.



void vncDisconnect(tSDL_vnc *vnc);

  Disconnect from vnc server

  Parameters
   vnc = pointer to tSDL_vnc structure

  Notes:
   - Closes socket connection and kills client thread. 
\endverbatim


\subsection tests Test Program

Change to the ./Test directory and run
\verbatim
	./configure
	make
\endverbatim
to creates a VNC client program. Run
\verbatim
	./TestVNC -help
\endverbatim

Typically one connects to a VNC server like this:
\verbatim
	./TestVNC -server myserver -password mypass
\endverbatim


Also see the source code TestVNC.c for sample code on how to 
create a simple VNC client.

\section dev_sec Development and To-Do

One can edit the SDL_vnc.c code to enable extensive debugging by setting the
DEBUG flag.

TODO:
- Add function to query server framebuffer size after connect.
- Fix CoRRE code
- Implement Desktop pseudoencoding
- Implement Bell (as callback)
- Implement ClientCutText
- Implement ZRLE protocol
- Implement tight protocol and options (zlib,tight,zlibhex)
  (Anyone have the specs for this?)
- Improved speed and interactive response
  (Implement a threaded socket reader. Check all code for optimizations.)
  ('vncviewer' feels a lot faster and more interactive.)
- Create proper SDL_keysym --> VNC key conversion routine.
- Add local-cursor sample code to TestVNC program.
